## Project Objective 
This project focuses on improving the generalization of medical diagnostic AI models across different hospitals and devices. Medical AI systems often fail to perform well across diverse sources due to domain shift (differences in scanners, imaging conditions, and patient groups).
To solve this, we implemented a Federated Learning (FL) framework that allows hospitals to collaboratively train a CNN-based diagnostic model without sharing sensitive patient data.

## Dataset Used
